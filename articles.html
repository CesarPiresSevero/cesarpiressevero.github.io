                <small><p class="text-muted">04/13/2025</p></small>
                <div class="collapse" id="despair">
                    How was it today?<br> 
                    Did you accomplish something? Did you have a bad day?<br>
                    Was it a significant one? Perhaps, was it your birthday?<br>
                    A day, 24 hours. But what does that mean?<br>
                    With the world’s average life expectancy at 73 years, that means you will probably have about 26 thousand of those days in your life. <br>
                    <br>
                    Can you count to 26 thousand? Can you imagine a book with 26 thousand pages?<br>
                    It sounds pretty long if you ask me. Do all these days have the same weight to them? Do they all feel like the same length?<br>
                    <br>
                    I believe I know your answer, no. They don’t feel like they have the same length. Probably, you would say that the days when you’re younger were the longest and they feel shorter and shorter with age. Why is that?<br>
                    Some may say because life becomes stable, routine takes over. It might as well be it. It also seems that we have fewer new experiences as time goes by.  Same job, same people, same hobbies, same house and so on. It is usually up to destiny to throw something new at us, to shake us up from the suburban slumber.<br>
                    <br>
                    Are we doing something wrong? No, it is the way we were evolved to be. Getting used to things by remembering past experiences. It is a double edged sword. It can help us to do tasks with excellence such as coding or drawing and to cope with tragedy, loss and grief.  But it also makes things bland, gray, dull and numb. There is a saying “short and sweet”. It might be that if it was not short we wouldn’t feel as sweet anymore. <br>
                    <br>
                    26 thousand days put into another perspective, a house fly lives for about 15 days. For a fly, our lifetime would be like 100 thousand years. Different branches of human ancestors, such as the Neanderthals were still roaming the Earth 100 thousand years ago. From this perspective, we live what feels like an eternal life. It might be that for the house fly, 15 days feels just like 73 years for us. Maybe, it also gets bored of the food or it doesn’t get as excited anymore when it barely misses the swatter by the 8th or 10th day. <br>
                    <br>
                    Let’s imagine that we actually live eternal lives. That may be whatever way, heaven and hell, roaming around as spirits or locked into an endless cycle of reincarnations. From this perspective, in the long run, heaven and hell wouldn’t be any different. In hell, we would get used to the suffering, meaning we wouldn’t suffer anymore. In heaven, we would get used to the bliss, meaning we wouldn’t enjoy it anymore at some point. If we consider the possibility of reincarnations, it would be the most enjoyable as, in general, we wouldn’t remember what went on in the past life. Starting anew, with the chance to suffer and enjoy life to its fullest. Until time passes and we get used to things again. I feel exhausted just thinking about it. Going through school, finding out that Santa isn’t real, getting my first job all over again. <br>
                    <br>
                    So I guess that’s it, in summary we are doomed. But are we? <br>
                    With the current perspective, yes. However, it can be understood from the previous paragraphs that the most important thing is not lifetime, in terms of years or days, but how we perceive it. How we perceive time and all that surrounds us.<br>
                    <br>
                    What would you do if you only had one day to live? <br>
                    What would you do if you would live forever? <br>
                    Which question is more exciting? Which question do you have an answer to? <br>
                    Probably the first. So, how was it today?<br>
